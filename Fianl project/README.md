This is a program that uses JavaScript to be nested in an HTML file.
HTML can be opened directly in Chrome, but JavaScript files need to be opened using the console in Chrome.
This program mainly targets browsers, and web pages. And this programming language is widely used.
Then this is a simple calculator. It can calculate addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Why is it a simple calculator, because this calculator can only calculate whole numbers.
I think this program can also be used for small programs nested in web pages,
also has inspired me, such as in interactive websites or shopping websites, in the settlement part.
Although it cannot be used directly, the situation will be more complicated, but I can learn some knowledge from it,
All the logical programming is presented in the Javascript section. The button settings, or appearance, are changed in html.
This announcement only needs to give three functions, x, y, z, and it can be directly operate on the Javascript.
For example, in addition, x+ y=z.
This calculation formula can be directly entered in JavaScript, and the result can be directly output.
Therefore, this program is very simple in terms of logic. I think the difficulty of learning HTML at the beginning is how to combine the appearance of buttons and javascript.
When I press any of these four buttons, the algorithm will be activated, and this button will correspond to the source code.
At the beginning, assign these buttons with English words to correspond

And there is also the size setting of the button,
Then enter the javascript part, assign the two parameters x and y to an actual parameter,
But this parameter is calculated based on integers,
Next is the most important part, this part is the core logic of this program,Although there are only four instructions
Then finally send the data to the screen through console.log
