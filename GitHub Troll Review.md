I found that when the new changes came up, the program would run and check, but unfortunately it failed.Because after it comes up, the program will be checked.

When I wanted to view the modified program code, I was told: "The logs for this run have expired and are no longer available." I don't know why.

There is a person who hopes to make some adjustments in this project. And there is also a developer who has posted his ideas on it. And the test of the program failed.

For website compatibility issues, some people commented on the situation they encountered and discussed the problems encountered with each other. This will provide a very good discussion platform for users who have the same problem in the future.And they finally solved the problem.

Some users encountered a problem during the use, and the developer discovered the problem and participated in the discussion. However, the developer seemed to have a technical problem. Netizens gave comments and helped the developer solve this technical problem.

I think that for an open source platform, you should not just enjoy its convenience, but also contribute to the continued development of this project. And you can also learn a lot of knowledge from it. And in the era of more and more developed networks, this kind of cooperation Open source projects will become more and more advanced. I am very optimistic about this way of working. And I think that in the future there will be AI technology to help management, and even participate in programming
