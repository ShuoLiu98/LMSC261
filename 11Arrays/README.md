# Arrays

## Compiling - a review

## Function Protyping in C
- Prototype
- Declare
- Call

## Compiling - in detail

## Header files in C
- Preprocessor directives
- Code you want to use in more than one file
- Prototypes certain functions for you
  ***e.g. stdio prototypes printf***

**Functions of some C libraries called by these Headers**
- [stdio.h](https://fresh2refresh.com/c-programming/c-function/stdio-h-library-functions/)
- [ctype.h](https://fresh2refresh.com/c-programming/c-function/c-ctype-h-library-functions/)
- [math.h](https://fresh2refresh.com/c-programming/c-function/c-math-h-library-functions/)
- [stdbool.h](https://fresh2refresh.com/c-programming/c-function/c-stdlib-h-library-functions/)
- [string.h](https://fresh2refresh.com/c-programming/c-function/string-h-library-functions/)

## Haiku Review

## Blocks and Nesting

## Data Types - how big they byte in C
- int 4 bytes
  - +/- 2,147,483,648
- float 4 bytes
- char 1 byte
- bool 1 byte

## Arrays
- List of stored values of the same data type called elements
- [brackets define the max # of elements in the array]
- Can be accessed with loops
- Structs, Pointers
